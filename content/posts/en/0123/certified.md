This week I received my second certificate from the [Linux Foundation](https://openjsf.org/certification/)<!-- endOfPreview -->:

![JSNSD](/img/0123/JSNSD.png "JSNSD")

![JSNAD](/img/0123/JSNAD.png "JSNAD")

The exam was similar to the JSNAD. There were very strict admission rules. I had to film my room for quite a while and show what was under my desk, mousepad, keyboard, etc.  
The required PSI browser wouldn't install on my laptop, so I had to switch to my desktop PC. Luckily, I had recently ordered a new camera, so the start of the exam was quite stressful.

This time, there was a new Linux distribution. I can't say exactly which one. Unfortunately, curly brackets {} didn't work on my keyboard, so I had to copy and paste them.  
Another challenge was that the search function on Fastify's docs pages didn't work, and many plugins couldn't be found there. However, since I was allowed to use the plugins for programming, I could read the Readme files in the _node_modules_.

The exam was fun, and the tasks were fair.

If you're looking for some continuing education and have $600 to spare, you can definitely go for this certification. Youâ€™ll learn the basics of service development. However, if you've already been doing this for 1-2 years, you probably won't learn much new.
